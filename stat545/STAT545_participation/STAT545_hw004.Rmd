## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Introduction

In this assigment, I will be reshaping and merging the `gapminder` dataset through the following tasks:

**Data reshaping**

*Prompt II*

Make a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries.

**Data joining**

*Prompt I*

Create a second dataframe looking at the country capitals and explore the join functions using this and the 'gapminder' dataframes.

First, I will need to load the `gapminder` dataset and `tidyverse` package:
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
```
# Data Reshaping
*Prompt 2*
Through this activity, I will reshape the data to show the yearly `lifeExp` for multiple countries. I have selected China, Canada, and Brazil as my countries.
I will start by extracting the lifeExp for China:
```{r}
LifeExpChina=gapminder %>% 
  filter(country=="China") %>% 
  select(year, lifeExp)
colnames(LifeExpChina) <- c("Year", "China")
knitr::kable(LifeExpChina, format = "markdown")
```
I will then do the same for Canada:
```{r}
LifeExpCanada=gapminder %>% 
  filter(country=="Canada") %>% 
  select(year, lifeExp) 
colnames(LifeExpCanada) <- c("Year", "Canada") 
knitr::kable(LifeExpCanada, format = "markdown")
```
And the same for Brazil:
```{r}
LifeExpBrazil=gapminder %>% 
  filter(country=="Brazil") %>% 
  select(year, lifeExp) 
colnames(LifeExpBrazil) <- c("Year", "Brazil")
knitr::kable(LifeExpBrazil, format = "markdown")
```
I will then merge the three datasets using the `left-join` function. This will be done in two steps:
```{r}
LifeExpChinaCanada=left_join(LifeExpChina,LifeExpCanada, by="Year")
LifeExpChinaCanadaBrazil=left_join(LifeExpChinaCanada,LifeExpBrazil,by="Year")
knitr::kable(LifeExpChinaCanadaBrazil, format = "markdown")
```

# Join Prompts
*Prompt I*
In this activity, I will create a second data frame complimentary to `gapminder` and explore the various join functions.
First, I will upload the `country_capitals.csv` data file, which contains the capitals of each country:
```{r}
count_capital <- read.csv("https://github.com/icyrockcom/country-capitals/raw/master/data/country-list.csv")
ls(count_capital)
nrow(count_capital) #number of rows in the count_capital dataset
nrow(gapminder) #number of rows in the gapminder dataset

```
## Left join
```{r}
left_join(gapminder,count_capital, by="country")
```
## Right join
```{r}
right_join(gapminder,count_capital, by="country")

```
## Anti join
```{r}
anti_join(gapminder,count_capital, by="country")

```
## Semi join
```{r}
semi_join(gapminder,count_capital, by="country")

```
## Inner join
```{r}
inner_join(gapminder,count_capital, by="country")

```
## Full join
```{r}
full_join(gapminder,count_capital, by="country")

```
