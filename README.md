This is a repository for the *4th* homework assignment by **Zachary Sherker** in the **STAT 545** course at the *University of British Columbia*.

I will be using the `dplyr` package to analyze the `gapminder` dataset.

In this assigment, I will be reshaping and merging the `gapminder` dataset through the following tasks:

-**Data reshaping**

*Prompt II*

Make a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries.

**Data joining**

*Prompt I*

Create a second dataframe looking at the country capitals and explore the join functions using this and the 'gapminder' dataframes.
